            In my time at Greenhat, I worked on a number of projects from domestic and international clients. I was in charge of organizing the project Github/Bitbucket Repo, organizing the project for development in Atlassian's JIRA project manager, initializing the project with modern frontend tooling and leading a team of developers to project completion. Much of our work was done in Wordpress, building custom templates and plugins from the ground up for the needs of our clients.
