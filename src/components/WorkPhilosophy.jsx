          <p>Web Development is more than just knowing how to code. In our ever evolving field, it is important for me to have an open mind so as to be receptive to new ideas from the team, the client and the community at large. To see the big picture as best I can and understand its moving parts. To not inhibit my growth by being loyal to any particular framework or language.</p>
